He rose quickly through the executive ranks and by 1997 had become chairman and chief executive of News Ltd. At the time, his father described Lachlan as his heir apparent, “the first among equals.” His ascension continued smoothly until 2005. That year, Lachlan abruptly quit his executive positions at News Corporation after a battle with Ailes over the direction of the cable news network – effectively taking himself off the heir apparent track. Lachlan then launched his own investment company, Illyria Pty, in Australia. After an extended absence, Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014 and resumed his position as a potential heir to the empire, becoming CEO of Fox Broadcasting and executive chairman at 21st Century Fox. Shortly after, Lachlan’s younger brother James was tapped to be CEO of 21st Century Fox in a power-sharing experiment orchestrated by Rupert between the brothers. The experiment proved unsuccessful, and Rupert sold 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019. Lachlan now holds the roles of executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation and co-chairman of News Corp, as well as executive chairman of NOVA Entertainment, an Australian media company.\n",

Yet there are groups of refugees who have trumped the odds. In this series, we feature an earlier wave of refugees who haven’t just survived, but are thriving today and giving back to their communities. Our culinary heroes originated from every part of Asia and fanned out across the globe in search of new lives. Today, they are using food in powerful ways and reshaping the way people see Asia. Behind each dish is a story of survival - stories of refugees who seek freedom from societies in conflict, of people who struggle to build new lives with treasured family recipes, and cities that have been enriched by their presence. This series proves that food can truly break down walls, and help us find the commonality across different people.\n",

      "\t \"SINGAPORE - Toyota's US$1 billion investment in Singapore-based ride-hailing platform Grab is credit positive for both companies, Moody's Investors Service said in a note released on Monday (June 18).\n",
      "\n",
      "The deal will enhance Toyota's foothold and capability in ride-hailing services, a \"fast-growing business that could alter automakers' traditional business models\", said Moody's, a credit ratings agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Grab will benefit from Toyota's technological capability. For instance, Toyota's driving recorder, which collects driving data and stores it in a central platform, will expand connectivity among Grab's rental car fleet across South-east Asia, said Moody's. This data will help both companies to roll out new services for drivers, including automotive insurance, auto leasing and vehicle maintenance.\"\n",

      "\t 1914 – 1943: FROM RICKSHAWS TO TRISHAWS\n",
      "\n",
      "The trishaw evolved from the rickshaw – a small, two-wheeled cart pulled by a man. \n",
      "\n",
      "Originating from Japan, rickshaws were first seen in Singapore in the 1880s. They were one of the earliest modes of transport in Singapore, alongside steam trams and bullock carts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rickshaw rides were inexpensive and ideal for short journeys through crowded inner-city streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first trishaws were officially registered in Singapore in 1914, according to Roots, a website by the National Heritage Board (NHB). Known as “pedal rickshaws”, these early trishaws were essentially modified rickshaws attached to bicycles. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the initial batch of 15 trishaws was said to be “crudely constructed” and did not last long on Singapore’s streets, according to the National Library Board’s (NLB) Infopedia website.\n",

Coincidentally, the date is Aug 19, the first day in which 50 per cent of work-from-home employees were allowed to return to the office following the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions in Singapore.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we settled in for our chat, Zou points out that in the morning, he had seen an uptick in fare prices on the Ryde app. That’s good for business, but it’s also good for the drivers on its platform. After all, Zou founded the company precisely to help these drivers earn an income.\n",
